# Stardust Graveyard

This repository is where my bad code goes to die.

More accurately, I rewrite the histories of old proof-of-concepts, prototypes, and failed rewrites into subfolders and merge them into the history here.

It seems better than just deleting the history entirely, while still cleaning up the repository list.
